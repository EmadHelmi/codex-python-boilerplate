# Construction and Policy Pattern Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when creating or refactoring factories, named constructors, object reconstitution, identity or time
generation, strategies, policies, registries, implementation-selection factories, or discriminator-driven behavior.

## Factories and Object Construction

- Prefer direct construction when creating an object only requires supplying valid state. Do not introduce a factory
  merely to wrap a constructor.
- Use a named constructor when creation represents a meaningful domain transition, selects a valid initial state, or
  deserves a domain-specific name. Do not add generic `create()` or `build()` methods that merely forward to
  `__init__`.
- Prefer construction paths that produce a valid object atomically. Do not require callers to create incomplete domain
  objects and populate mandatory state through setters.
- Prefer a factory function when construction is stateless and does not require polymorphism, lifecycle, or injected
  dependencies.
- Introduce a factory object only when construction has meaningful policy, requires collaborators, selects
  implementations, or coordinates multiple construction steps.
- Keep factories focused on construction. Persistence, transactions, messaging, cross-aggregate coordination, and
  application workflow belong elsewhere.
- Prefer passing already-loaded domain state into a factory rather than letting it orchestrate repositories.
- Keep identity generation consistent with the domain and persistence model; do not move database-owned identity
  generation into the domain merely for architectural purity.
- Avoid hiding important nondeterministic dependencies such as time, randomness, or identity generation inside domain
  construction when callers or tests need control over them.
- Distinguish creation of a new domain object from reconstitution of persisted state. Repositories must not invoke
  creation behavior that regenerates identity, resets lifecycle state, or emits creation events while loading an
  existing object.
- Keep reconstitution APIs domain-neutral; do not introduce persistence terminology into domain types solely to support
  mapping.
- Use a factory or registry when construction depends on a code-owned discriminator and centralized selection removes
  repeated branching from callers.

## Strategy and Policy Patterns

- Introduce Strategy only when behavior genuinely varies behind a stable contract and callers benefit from independence
  from concrete implementations. Prefer straightforward branching when variation is small, local, and unlikely to
  grow.
- Name strategies after the capability or policy that varies. When they represent business behavior, use ubiquitous
  domain language rather than generic `Strategy` names.
- Keep strategy contracts narrow and cohesive. Split independent variation points instead of combining unrelated
  behavior in one strategy interface.
- Keep strategies stateless by default. Store state only when explicitly part of their behavior or lifecycle.
- Keep implementation selection outside concrete strategies. A strategy should implement one behavior, not decide
  which strategy should have been selected.
- Centralize strategy selection in one registry, factory, or composition point. Do not repeat discriminator-to-
  implementation branching across callers.
- Prefer a simple registry for static, code-owned mappings. Use a factory when selection also requires construction
  logic, dependencies, or configuration.
- Select code strategies from code-owned domain or configuration values. Do not query persistence merely to discover
  which Python implementation should run unless runtime-pluggable behavior is an explicit requirement.
- Prefer configuration to parameterize behavior rather than naming concrete implementation classes.
- Keep domain strategies independent of ORM, HTTP, framework, and transport concerns. Pass required domain state
  explicitly or depend on an inward-owned port when necessary.
- Distinguish domain-policy strategies from infrastructure adapters. Domain strategies encode business variation;
  infrastructure strategies implement technical capabilities behind an inner-layer port.
- Do not replace clear domain conditionals with polymorphism solely to eliminate `if` statements. Use Strategy when the
  variation itself is a stable concept.
- Prefer structural contracts for strategies. Add a shared base class only when concrete strategies genuinely share
  implementation or lifecycle behavior.
- Use a default strategy only when fallback behavior is an explicit part of the contract. Unknown discriminators should
  otherwise fail explicitly.
- When a finite discriminator requires complete strategy coverage, validate or test registry completeness so new values
  cannot silently bypass implementation.
