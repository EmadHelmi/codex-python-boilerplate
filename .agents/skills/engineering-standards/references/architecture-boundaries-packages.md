# Module and Bounded-Context Boundary Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when creating, moving, or reorganizing packages or modules; changing cross-layer or cross-context
imports; defining public seams or shared kernels; wiring dependencies; using composition roots; enforcing architecture;
or deciding package structure.

## Cross-Boundary and Module Boundaries

- Give each architectural module or bounded context a small, deliberate public seam. External callers should depend on
  that seam instead of importing internal implementation modules directly.
- Treat code outside the declared public seam as implementation detail, even when Python permits importing it.
- Do not use another bounded context's ORM models, repositories, or internal services as cross-context contracts.
  Exchange stable identities, explicit DTOs, application contracts, or events instead.
- Cross boundaries using stable identities or explicit snapshots and contracts rather than mutable domain objects owned
  by another context.
- Keep shared-kernel code minimal and genuinely universal. Do not move domain concepts into `shared`, `common`, `core`,
  or `utils` merely because multiple contexts currently use them.
- Prefer small intentional duplication over cross-context coupling when concepts may evolve independently.
- Share a domain abstraction only when its meaning, invariants, and lifecycle are genuinely shared, not merely because
  names or current fields look similar.
- Make dependencies between bounded contexts directional and explicit. Avoid mutual imports and bidirectional service
  dependencies.
- Translate external or foreign domain models at their boundary. Do not let another system's terminology, schemas,
  status codes, or object model accidentally become the internal domain model.
- Design integration contracts independently from internal object structure. Do not serialize entities or aggregates
  wholesale as external or cross-context contracts.
- Inner layers must depend on contracts, not concrete outer-layer implementations. Bind implementations at the
  composition root or another explicit assembly boundary.
- Centralize dependency assembly in a composition root or equivalent boundary. Do not instantiate concrete
  infrastructure dependencies throughout domain and application code.
- Prefer explicit constructor or function injection. Introduce a dependency-injection framework only when assembly
  complexity justifies it.
- Avoid service-locator patterns in domain and application code. Keep dependencies visible in constructors or function
  signatures.
- Treat circular imports between architectural modules as a design signal. Do not use `TYPE_CHECKING`, local imports,
  or import indirection merely to conceal circular dependencies.
- Keep public seams intentionally small. Expose only contracts other modules are expected to depend on.
- For cross-context reporting and read composition, prefer dedicated query or read models instead of coupling domain
  aggregates solely for presentation needs.
- Do not couple bounded contexts merely to obtain a shared database transaction. Require immediate cross-context
  consistency only when a business invariant truly demands it; otherwise prefer explicit coordination or eventual
  consistency.

## Architecture Enforcement

- Treat stable architectural dependency rules as executable constraints when practical, not merely documentation or
  code-review conventions.
- Enforce layer direction, forbidden dependencies, bounded-context cycles, and protected internal modules with
  architecture tooling instead of relying on developers to remember them.
- Keep architectural exceptions explicit and narrowly scoped. Do not weaken a contract globally to accommodate one
  exceptional dependency.
- Do not use `TYPE_CHECKING`, local imports, dynamic imports, or indirection to bypass an architectural dependency rule.
- Keep architecture checks in normal validation and CI so dependency violations fail before merge.
- Test semantic architectural invariants with ordinary tests when import constraints cannot express them reliably. Do
  not add architecture-specific tooling for rules that existing linters, type checkers, or tests already enforce well.
- Every architecture-contract exception must be narrow, documented, and temporary or structurally justified. Never add
  wildcard ignores merely to make architecture checks pass.

## Package and Folder Structure

- Organize packages around meaningful architectural or domain boundaries. Do not create layers or directories solely
  to match a Clean Architecture template.
- Prefer organizing substantial business code by domain capability or bounded context instead of globally grouping
  everything by technical role.
- Introduce subpackages such as `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, or `presentation` only when the corresponding
  responsibility is substantial enough to justify a package.
- Do not create one-file directory hierarchies merely to advertise architectural layers. Let depth grow with real
  complexity.
- Group code by cohesive concepts before artifact type. Create `entities`, `services`, `events`, `repositories`, or
  similar subpackages only when doing so materially improves navigation.
- Keep tightly related domain types close together. Split modules when they become difficult to navigate or contain
  independently evolving concepts.
- Do not enforce one class or type per file. Prefer cohesive modules over artificial fragmentation.
- Avoid generic `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, or `misc` packages for code with a clear domain or architectural owner.
- Keep shared packages small and domain-neutral; do not use them to avoid choosing an owner for business behavior.
- Structure infrastructure according to concrete technical capabilities when that improves ownership; do not force one
  universal adapter taxonomy.
- Organize application code around cohesive use cases when practical. Keep a use case's command, result, and
  orchestration close together unless shared contracts justify separation.
- Prefer package names that communicate ownership or capability. Avoid vague buckets such as `managers`, `processors`,
  or generic `services` when a more precise concept exists.
- Make package structure reinforce the declared public seam without requiring a specific facade filename or folder
  naming scheme.
- Do not assume framework boundaries such as Django apps are identical to bounded contexts. Align them when useful, but
  keep architectural boundaries explicit when they differ.
