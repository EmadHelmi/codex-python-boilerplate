# Python Observability Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when adding or changing logging, log levels, exception logging, structured context, metrics, metric
dimensions, tracing, telemetry, operational diagnostics, or health signaling in Python code.

## Logging

- Use the project's logging abstraction when one exists; otherwise use a module logger created with
  `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
- Choose log levels by operational meaning: use `debug` for diagnostic detail, `info` for meaningful normal operation,
  `warning` for abnormal conditions the system can continue through, and `error` or `exception` for failed operations
  that require investigation. Reserve `critical` for failures that threaten continued service or a major subsystem.
- Do not log expected business outcomes as system failures merely because they are represented by exceptions. Choose
  severity from operational significance, not from whether control flow used an exception.
- Include a traceback when it materially helps diagnose an unexpected failure. Do not attach tracebacks to routine or
  expected outcomes merely because they were implemented with exceptions.
- Log a failure at the boundary that has enough context to make it actionable. Do not log and re-log the same
  propagated exception at multiple architectural layers.
- Log meaningful operational events, state transitions, boundary failures, and diagnostic information. Do not add logs
  merely to narrate ordinary control flow or every function entry and exit.
- Never log secrets, credentials, private keys, access tokens, authentication material, or sensitive data that is not
  required for the operational purpose of the log.
- Prefer structured, queryable context supported by the project logger, adapter, or `extra` fields. Attach relevant
  stable identifiers and dimensions as fields instead of embedding large objects or machine-relevant data only inside
  free-form message text.
- Keep log event messages stable enough to group and search operationally. Put variable identifiers and dimensions in
  structured fields when the logging stack supports them.
- Preserve request, trace, correlation, or message context across asynchronous and service boundaries when the
  project's observability stack provides such context. Do not invent parallel correlation mechanisms without a
  concrete need.

## Metrics

- Use the project's existing metrics abstraction, semantic conventions, and naming scheme. Do not introduce a parallel
  instrumentation style without a concrete need.
- Choose the metric instrument from the value's semantics: use monotonic counters for cumulative values that do not
  decrease; use a gauge or supported up/down-style instrument for values that can increase or decrease; and use
  histograms or other distribution instruments for observed distributions such as latency or size.
- Measure latency, size, and other meaningful distributions with a distribution instrument rather than recording only
  an average or the most recent value.
- Choose histogram buckets or resolution from the expected value range and operational thresholds. Do not copy default
  buckets blindly when they poorly represent the workload.
- Prefer aggregatable distribution metrics when observations must be combined across workers or instances. Use
  client-side summaries or quantile instruments only when their aggregation limitations are understood.
- Keep metric dimensions bounded and operationally meaningful. Never use user IDs, order IDs, request IDs, timestamps,
  raw URLs, arbitrary strings, or other unbounded values as metric labels or attributes.
- Normalize variable dimensions before using them as metric attributes. Prefer bounded values such as route templates,
  operation names, status classes, or controlled enums over raw externally supplied values.
- Do not use exception messages, free-form error text, stack traces, or other uncontrolled strings as metric
  dimensions. Use bounded failure categories when a failure dimension is operationally useful.
- Keep metric names stable. Represent bounded variations as labels or attributes rather than generating metric names
  dynamically.
- Keep each metric focused on one logical quantity with consistent semantics and units across all dimensions. Split
  measurements whose values cannot be meaningfully aggregated together.
- Use consistent base units and follow the naming conventions of the project's metrics backend. For Prometheus-native
  metrics, follow Prometheus unit and counter suffix conventions; for OpenTelemetry instrumentation, follow its metric
  and semantic conventions.
- Instrument important operations so their volume and meaningful outcomes can be derived, especially at service,
  application, queue, datastore, and external-system boundaries.
- Instrument meaningful business outcomes when they help explain system health or behavior.
- Measure meaningful boundaries and outcomes rather than every internal function or implementation detail.
- Keep recurring metric dimensions and values semantically consistent across the codebase. Reuse established attribute
  names and bounded vocabularies.
- Keep instrumentation observational. Metric collection must not determine business outcomes, mutate domain state, or
  hide the original application failure.
- Do not make ordinary application success depend on telemetry export succeeding unless telemetry delivery is itself
  an explicit business requirement.
- Keep instrumentation cost proportional to its operational value. Avoid expensive metric computation or excessive
  instrumentation on hot paths.

## Tracing and Correlation

- Use the project's existing tracing abstraction and instrumentation stack. Prefer well-supported framework and
  library instrumentation over duplicating spans or context propagation manually.
- Add manual spans for meaningful application, workflow, or external-operation boundaries not already represented by
  automatic instrumentation. Do not trace every helper or function merely to increase span count.
- Keep span names stable and low-cardinality. Name the operation rather than a specific request, entity, identifier,
  URL instance, or payload value.
- Put useful operation context in span attributes instead of encoding variable values into span names. Avoid attaching
  large objects, payloads, or unnecessary identifiers.
- Reuse established telemetry semantic conventions for common protocols and concepts. Introduce custom attributes only
  when no appropriate standard semantic field exists.
- Preserve tracing context across process, service, asynchronous-task, and messaging boundaries. Use the propagation
  mechanism provided by the project's instrumentation stack.
- Propagate tracing context manually only when automatic or library-level propagation cannot represent the boundary
  correctly.
- Correlate logs with traces through native observability-context integration when available. Do not manually thread
  trace or span identifiers through application APIs solely for logging.
- Reuse existing request, correlation, and trace identities consistently. Do not create parallel identifiers unless
  they have distinct operational or contractual semantics.
- Keep propagated baggage minimal and explicitly justified. Never use baggage for credentials, secrets, sensitive
  personal data, large payloads, or arbitrary application state.
- Treat propagated context crossing untrusted boundaries according to the project's trust policy. Do not blindly trust
  arbitrary incoming baggage or expose unnecessary internal tracing context externally.
- Mark tracing errors from operation semantics, not merely from the presence of an exception. Do not automatically
  classify expected business rejections as service failures.
- Avoid recording the same failure redundantly on every nested span. Record it at the boundary that best represents the
  failed operation unless instrumentation already captures it appropriately.
- Keep trace sampling and export policy outside business behavior. Application correctness must not depend on whether
  telemetry is sampled or exported.
- Keep tracing observational. Instrumentation must not swallow exceptions, change transaction semantics, alter return
  values, or otherwise change application behavior.

## Telemetry Integrations

- Prefer the observability stack already adopted by the project. Do not introduce a new telemetry vendor, SDK,
  exporter, or transport merely to instrument one feature.
- Keep domain and core application behavior independent of vendor-specific telemetry SDKs. Configure and adapt
  observability integrations at application, infrastructure, or bootstrap boundaries.
- Prefer established semantic conventions and structured fields over vendor-specific naming when doing so preserves
  interoperability with the project's observability pipeline.
- Keep vendor-specific transport, schema, filtering, sampling, and SDK conventions in integration-specific project
  rules rather than reusable Python observability rules.
- Do not emit the same telemetry independently to multiple backends when the project's collector or observability
  pipeline can fan it out centrally.

## Health Signaling

- Keep liveness, readiness, and startup semantics distinct. A liveness failure should represent a condition where
  restarting the process is a meaningful recovery action; temporary dependency unavailability should not normally make
  the process appear dead.
- Keep health checks lightweight, deterministic, and free of side effects. They must not perform expensive work merely
  to prove that the application is healthy.
- Let application code expose the minimum health state required by the runtime, while deployment configuration owns
  probe transport, cadence, timeouts, thresholds, restart behavior, and rollout policy.
- Include external dependencies in readiness only when their availability is genuinely required for the instance to
  serve its intended workload. Do not turn health checks into exhaustive diagnostics of every connected system.
