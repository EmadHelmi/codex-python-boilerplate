# Python Tooling Standards

Classification: **BOILERPLATE / REUSABLE PROJECT BASELINE**.

Application: Read when changing Python dependencies, environments, tooling commands, lint or type-checking
configuration, or project configuration.

## uv

- Treat `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` as the project dependency sources of truth.
- Use `uv add` and `uv remove` to change dependencies. Do not use `pip` directly for project dependency management and
  do not hand-edit `uv.lock`.
- Add development-only tools with `uv add --dev <package>` unless the project deliberately uses another dependency
  group.
- The `dev` dependency group is included by default by normal `uv sync` and `uv run` workflows. Do not add `--dev` to
  ordinary local commands merely to make development dependencies available.
- Run project tools through `uv run` unless the repository provides a canonical wrapper such as `make`, `just`, `tox`,
  `nox`, or a project script.
- Respect the Python version declared by the project. Do not silently upgrade or downgrade it.

## Ruff

- Ruff is the canonical Python formatter, linter, and import sorter for this project. Do not introduce Black, isort,
  Flake8, or overlapping style tools unless explicitly requested.
- Let Ruff configuration decide formatting, line length, import ordering, enabled lint rules, and per-file exceptions.
- Remember that import sorting is a linter fix, not part of `ruff format`.
- Do not add lint suppressions merely to make a check pass. Fix the code when practical.

## Pyright and Pylance

- Pyright is the reproducible project type checker. Pylance is the editor language server powered by Pyright.
- Keep shared type-checking policy in project configuration, preferably `[tool.pyright]` in `pyproject.toml`, rather
  than relying on developer-specific editor settings.
- Do not treat Pylance-only editor diagnostics as a substitute for a repeatable Pyright CLI check when the project
  expects type checking in CI or review.
- Do not weaken type-checking configuration to accommodate one local error unless the change is an explicit project
  decision.
