# Event and Consistency Workflow Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when creating or changing domain or integration events, handlers, brokers, queues, outbox delivery,
side effects, transactions, retries, compensation, sagas or process managers, choreography, orchestration, or eventual
consistency.

## Domain and Integration Events

- Emit a domain event only for a business-significant fact that has already occurred. Name events as facts, preferably
  in past tense; do not use events as commands.
- Record an event at the point where the domain transition making it true succeeds. Do not reconstruct domain events
  later from mutated state when the domain object owns that decision.
- Domain objects may record events but must not publish them through brokers, task queues, framework signals, or
  infrastructure event buses directly.
- Make domain events immutable and keep their payload explicit and minimal. Include stable identities and event-time
  business facts required by consumers; do not attach mutable aggregates, ORM models, requests, or infrastructure
  objects.
- Include event-time values when consumers need the fact as it existed when the event occurred; do not force consumers
  to reload mutable state when doing so could change the event's meaning.
- Distinguish domain events from integration events. Domain events are internal domain facts; integration events are
  explicit, versioned contracts crossing process or service boundaries. Translate between them at the application or
  infrastructure boundary.
- Do not assume domain events require asynchronous messaging. Choose synchronous or asynchronous handling from
  consistency, latency, failure, and coupling requirements.
- A domain event must describe a transition that is already valid. Do not rely on handlers to complete the invariant
  that justified emitting the event.
- Treat event handlers as application entry points. They may coordinate new use cases or aggregates but should not
  bypass domain behavior.
- Never expose an event externally as committed fact before the transaction establishing it succeeds.
- Use a transactional outbox when external event delivery must be durably consistent with a database commit. Do not
  introduce an outbox when its delivery guarantees do not justify the complexity.
- Design integration-event consumers for retries and duplicate delivery. Make externally triggered side effects
  idempotent where practical.
- Add event identity, occurrence time, correlation, causation, or similar metadata only when required by delivery,
  observability, ordering, or idempotency concerns.
- Do not rely on global event ordering unless the messaging architecture explicitly guarantees it. Scope ordering
  requirements deliberately around the relevant stream or aggregate identity.
- Define handler failure semantics deliberately; transaction, retry, and delivery behavior must not emerge accidentally
  from handler failures.
- Do not replace straightforward synchronous application flow with events merely to reduce direct dependencies. Use
  events when independent reactions, temporal decoupling, eventual consistency, or extensibility provide concrete
  value.

## Transactions, Side Effects, and Consistency

- Define business transaction boundaries in the application use case or an explicit Unit of Work boundary. Domain
  objects must not know about transactions, and repositories must not secretly own multi-step business transactions.
- Keep transactions as small as correctness permits. Perform unrelated computation, serialization, logging, and
  external I/O outside the transaction.
- Do not perform irreversible or slow external side effects while holding a database transaction by default.
- Trigger side effects requiring committed state only after the local transaction succeeds. Never expose a state
  transition externally while the establishing transaction can still roll back.
- Distinguish post-commit ordering from durable delivery. An after-commit callback prevents premature side effects but
  does not guarantee delivery after a process crash.
- Treat a database transaction as atomic only for resources it controls. Do not assume its semantics extend to brokers,
  caches, external APIs, or other datastores.
- Do not introduce distributed transactions merely to simulate one global atomic operation. Prefer local transactions
  with explicit coordination, idempotency, durable messaging, or compensation when the business permits it.
- When a workflow spans independent consistency boundaries, make eventual consistency explicit. Model intermediate
  states, retries, and recovery rather than pretending the workflow is atomic.
- Treat compensation as a new business action, not as a distributed rollback. Design compensating behavior explicitly
  for completed external effects that must be semantically undone.
- Do not assume every side effect is reversible. Identify irreversible actions and design workflow ordering and failure
  semantics accordingly.
- Introduce a saga or process manager when a long-running workflow coordinates multiple independent transactions, owns
  meaningful intermediate state, and requires explicit retries, compensation, or recovery. Do not introduce one for
  workflows that remain clearer as ordinary synchronous orchestration.
- Keep workflow coordination state separate from core domain entities unless the workflow itself is a genuine domain
  concept.
- Prefer explicit orchestration when a workflow has important ordering, recovery, or compensation semantics. Use
  choreography when reactions are genuinely independent and no central component owns the workflow.
- Do not use event choreography merely to hide direct workflow dependencies.
- Distinguish local mutation, internal events, integration events, and commands sent to external systems; each has
  different consistency and failure semantics.
- Do not base correctness on assumed exactly-once delivery. Design external operations and consumers to tolerate
  retries and duplicate delivery.
- Assign retry ownership deliberately. Avoid stacked retry loops across layers unless their interaction is understood.
- Keep retries bounded and observable, with deliberate backoff and terminal-failure behavior. Retry transient failures
  instead of deterministic business outcomes.
- Preserve recorded domain events until the transaction outcome is known. Do not clear or expose them in a way that can
  lose events on rollback or commit failure.
- Decide explicitly whether synchronous event handlers participate in the originating transaction. Handlers required
  for the same local invariant may run inside it; independent side effects should normally occur after commit.
- Use a Unit of Work when it materially clarifies transaction ownership and repository coordination; do not add one
  when the framework's transaction boundary is already sufficient.
