# Python Core Standards

Classification: **HYBRID**.

Application: Read when creating or changing Python source or test files.

## Change Discipline

- Inspect the nearest relevant implementation, tests, and project configuration before editing. Follow established
  local patterns unless an applicable project rule explicitly requires otherwise.
- Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the task. Do not refactor, rename, or clean up unrelated code.
- Preserve public behavior and compatibility unless the task explicitly requires a behavior change.
- Treat project configuration and tool output as the source of truth for formatting, linting, and typing. Do not
  hand-format code in a way that fights configured tools.
- Do not add broad suppressions such as file-wide `noqa`, `type: ignore`, or checker disables. When a suppression is
  unavoidable, scope it to the smallest location and document the concrete reason.

## Readability and Design

- Prefer straightforward code over cleverness or speculative abstraction.
- Keep responsibilities cohesive. Extract helpers when they make a meaningful unit easier to understand, test, or
  reuse; do not apply arbitrary function-length or caller-count thresholds.
- Avoid mutable default arguments.
- Use keyword-only parameters when they improve API clarity or prevent ambiguous calls.
- Prefer explicit control flow when a comprehension, conditional expression, or lambda would obscure intent.
- Use context managers or `try`/`finally` for deterministic resource cleanup.

## Errors and Runtime Behavior

- Raise the most specific appropriate built-in or project exception.
- Keep `try` blocks limited to operations that can raise the exceptions being handled.
- Do not catch `Exception` merely to hide failures. Broad catches are acceptable only at intentional isolation
  boundaries where the failure is handled, translated, logged, or re-raised deliberately.
- Do not use `assert` for user input validation, authorization, or runtime guarantees that must remain active in
  optimized Python execution.

## Type Annotations

- Follow the project's minimum supported Python version and configured type checker.
- Prefer modern type syntax supported by that minimum version, including built-in generics and `X | None` when
  available.
- Annotate public boundaries and code whose types are not obvious from local context.
- Prefer precise types over `Any`; use `Any` intentionally at genuinely dynamic or untyped boundaries.
- Avoid adding type-checker workarounds when the underlying design or import dependency can be fixed cleanly.

## Documentation

- Update nearby documentation when behavior or a public contract changes.
- Add docstrings where they explain a non-obvious public contract or important private invariant. Do not add
  boilerplate docstrings that merely repeat the signature.
- Comments should explain intent, constraints, tradeoffs, or surprising behavior rather than restating code.

## Validation

- Prefer repository-provided validation commands when they exist.
- Otherwise, before completing a Python change, run the narrowest relevant checks already configured for the project.
  In this baseline, those checks typically include Ruff linting, Ruff formatting checks, Pyright, and affected tests.
- Do not add or install a missing validation tool solely to satisfy this fallback guidance.
- If a configured check cannot run, report that explicitly rather than claiming validation succeeded.
