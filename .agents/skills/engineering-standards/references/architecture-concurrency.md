# Concurrency and State Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when changing shared state, aggregate mutation, concurrent reads or writes, database consistency
constraints, optimistic or pessimistic locking, idempotency, eventual-consistency state, caches, or distributed locks.

## State, Mutability, and Concurrency

- Give mutable state a clear owner. Avoid shared mutable state whose mutation can occur from unrelated modules or
  execution paths.
- Avoid mutable module-level or process-global state for application and domain behavior. Use explicit ownership and
  dependency injection when shared state is required.
- Encapsulate meaningful state changes behind operations that preserve invariants. Do not expose mutable state so
  callers must coordinate valid transitions themselves.
- Prefer immutability for value objects, messages, configuration, and other values representing facts. Allow controlled
  mutation for entities and aggregates whose lifecycle is inherently stateful.
- Do not assume an in-memory domain invariant is safe under concurrent persistence. Identify invariants involving
  concurrent reads and writes and protect them at the transaction or persistence boundary.
- Place reads, checks, and writes that jointly protect an invariant inside the same effective concurrency boundary. Do
  not validate stale state and wrap only the final write in a transaction.
- Do not treat a transaction block alone as proof of concurrency safety. Use the appropriate database mechanism:
  locking, version checks, conditional updates, uniqueness, or other constraints.
- Enforce critical persistence invariants at the database level when expressible reliably. Domain validation should not
  be the only protection against concurrent writes.
- Prefer optimistic concurrency when conflicts are uncommon and stale writes must be detected explicitly.
- Use pessimistic locking when an invariant genuinely requires exclusive access. Keep locked transactions short and
  avoid locking as a default safety mechanism.
- Do not perform network calls or slow external I/O while holding database locks or long-lived transactions.
- Design retryable commands and externally triggered state changes to be idempotent when duplicate execution is
  possible.
- Make eventual-consistency boundaries explicit. Model intermediate states, retries, and failure behavior rather than
  assuming immediate synchronization.
- Represent meaningful asynchronous or long-running lifecycle states explicitly instead of hiding them behind transient
  booleans or infrastructure-only state.
- Avoid treating long-lived in-memory aggregates as authoritative when concurrent writers may exist. Reload or use an
  explicit concurrency strategy before committing stale mutable state.
- Treat caches as derived state unless explicitly designed as authoritative.
- Prefer database constraints, atomic updates, optimistic concurrency, and local locking before introducing distributed
  locks.
