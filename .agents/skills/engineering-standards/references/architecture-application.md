# Application and Service Boundary Standards

Classification: **GENERAL / ECOSYSTEM / PROJECT-NEUTRAL**.

Application: Read when creating or changing use cases, application or domain services, commands, queries, DTOs, read
models, projections, CQRS, result models, exception boundaries, validation boundaries, or cross-layer mapping.

## Domain and Application Services

- Prefer behavior on the entity or value object that naturally owns the invariant. Introduce a domain service only
  when important domain behavior does not belong naturally to a single domain object.
- Use a domain service for stateless domain behavior that spans multiple domain concepts and has no natural entity or
  value-object owner.
- Name domain services after the domain capability or policy they represent. Avoid vague `<Entity>Service` names when a
  more precise domain term exists.
- Keep domain services independent of persistence and application orchestration. Prefer passing required domain state
  instead of injecting repositories or infrastructure dependencies.
- If domain behavior genuinely requires an external capability, depend on an inner-layer-owned port rather than a
  concrete infrastructure implementation.
- Use application services or use cases to orchestrate a user or system goal: load required state, invoke domain
  behavior, coordinate aggregates and ports, define transaction boundaries, and produce an application result.
- Do not duplicate entity, value-object, or aggregate invariants in application services. Invoke domain behavior rather
  than reconstructing business rules from domain state.
- Distinguish domain decisions from workflow decisions. Rules about what the business means belong in the domain;
  decisions about application flow or external adapters belong in the application layer.
- Prefer application services or use cases with one cohesive goal. Avoid generic services that accumulate unrelated
  operations around an entity.
- Use a function for a simple stateless use case. Introduce a class when the use case owns meaningful dependencies,
  configuration, lifecycle, or reusable orchestration.
- When a class represents exactly one application use case, a single `execute()` entry point is acceptable. Domain
  services should expose domain-language operations instead of generic `execute()` methods.
- Keep application inputs and outputs independent of delivery and persistence frameworks. Use commands, DTOs,
  identities, domain values, or application result types instead of requests, serializers, query objects, ORM models,
  or task-framework objects.
- Coordinate side effects in the application layer and preserve transaction semantics. Side effects requiring committed
  state must occur only after the commit succeeds.

## DTOs, Commands, Queries, and Boundary Models

- Use explicit boundary types when data crosses an architectural boundary and the shape has meaningful semantics. Do
  not introduce DTOs merely to copy fields between nearby functions with no real boundary.
- Prefer typed boundary models over unstructured dictionaries when the shape is known and stable. Use mappings or
  `Any` only at genuinely dynamic boundaries.
- Keep DTOs, commands, and result models primarily as data contracts. Do not move domain behavior or invariants into
  transport objects.
- Use a command to represent an explicit application intent that may change system state. Name it after the requested
  action rather than the underlying entity or transport payload.
- Use a query to represent a meaningful application read request. Queries must not mutate domain state as a side
  effect.
- Do not require a command or query object for every application call. Pass explicit parameters when smaller and
  clearer.
- Make commands, queries, and simple boundary DTOs immutable by default unless mutation is part of their purpose.
- Do not use ORM models, serializers, HTTP objects, or framework-specific schemas as cross-layer DTOs. Translate them
  at the boundary that owns the framework.
- Do not confuse domain objects with DTOs. Domain objects model behavior and invariants; DTOs model data crossing a
  boundary.
- Perform mapping at the boundary that owns the translation. Domain objects should not know how to serialize themselves
  for HTTP, ORM, queues, or external APIs.
- Use simple mapping functions by default. Introduce mapper objects only when mapping has meaningful state,
  configuration, polymorphism, or complexity.
- Application result types should expose application or domain outcomes, not presentation concerns such as HTTP status
  codes, response envelopes, or localized messages.
- Do not introduce generic `Result` or `Either` wrappers by default. Use ordinary return values and explicit domain or
  application exceptions unless error-as-data semantics provide concrete value.
- Treat DTOs crossing process or public API boundaries as versioned external contracts. Preserve compatibility or
  provide an explicit migration strategy when they change.

## Read Models, Query Architecture, and CQRS

- Do not introduce full CQRS merely to follow an architectural pattern. Use a conventional shared read/write model when
  the domain and access requirements remain simple.
- Design the write model around domain behavior, invariants, and consistency. Do not distort aggregate boundaries or
  domain objects merely to satisfy read or presentation needs.
- Optimize read paths for the information callers need. Use projections, joins, denormalized data, or specialized read
  models rather than loading aggregates that will not perform domain behavior.
- Allow read-model implementations to use persistence technology directly when it keeps the query simple and isolated.
  Do not force aggregate-repository abstractions onto read-only paths.
- Do not leak ORM query objects or query-building APIs across the application boundary. Return explicit read models or
  application-facing result types.
- Keep read models separate from domain objects when their shape exists for presentation, reporting, search, or query
  efficiency rather than domain behavior.
- Allow read models to duplicate or denormalize data when doing so materially improves query simplicity or performance.
- Apply CQRS selectively to bounded contexts or use cases that benefit. Do not require system-wide CQRS for consistency
  of style.
- Separate read and write datastores only when independent scaling, query shape, latency, availability, or technology
  requirements justify the operational complexity.
- When read models update asynchronously, treat staleness and eventual consistency as explicit application behavior.
- Do not use an eventually consistent read model as the authoritative source for command-side invariants. Revalidate
  business-critical conditions against the authoritative write-side consistency boundary.
- Keep query paths free from domain state transitions and command-side business behavior. Read models may derive
  presentation values but must not become an alternate place for domain policy.
- Read models may expose presentation-oriented capability hints, but command-side authorization and invariants must
  still be evaluated authoritatively.
- Enforce access control and data-exposure rules on query paths. Separating reads from writes does not remove
  authorization requirements from reads.
- Name queries and read services after the information or use case they provide. Avoid generic `get_data`, `fetch`, or
  `<Entity>QueryService` APIs that hide intent.
- Do not introduce generic query repositories that recreate ORM filtering and pagination. Prefer explicit query
  contracts for meaningful read use cases.
- Represent filtering, sorting, and pagination through explicit query parameters or query-specific types instead of
  leaking persistence lookup syntax across boundaries.
- Prefer datastore-native aggregation and projection for reporting and read-heavy workloads. Do not hydrate domain
  aggregates merely to count, group, search, or summarize data.
- Treat Event Sourcing and CQRS as independent choices. Do not introduce Event Sourcing merely because read and write
  models are separated.
- Do not require asynchronous messaging merely because commands and queries are separated. Commands may execute
  synchronously when that best fits the use case.
- When a read model is asynchronously derived from authoritative data, provide repair or rebuild mechanisms when its
  operational importance justifies them.

## Exceptions and Error Boundaries

- Define domain exceptions for business failures with meaningful domain semantics. Prefer precise domain names over
  generic `DomainError`, `BusinessError`, or `OperationFailed` failures.
- Define exceptions in the innermost layer owning the failure's meaning. Outer layers may translate technical failures
  into inner-layer concepts; inner layers must not depend on framework or infrastructure exception types.
- Do not leak database, ORM, HTTP-client, broker, filesystem, or framework exceptions across architectural boundaries.
  Translate them when callers need stable domain or application meaning.
- Translate an exception only when crossing a boundary changes its meaning or hides an implementation detail. Do not
  wrap every exception in a generic application or domain error.
- Catch exceptions only where code can recover, translate, add meaningful context, enforce a boundary policy, or
  perform required cleanup. Otherwise let them propagate.
- Use broad exception catches only at intentional isolation boundaries where arbitrary failures must be contained,
  observed, translated, or retried.
- Preserve causal context when translating through explicit exception chaining unless intentionally suppressing the
  original cause is part of the boundary contract.
- Use built-in exceptions for ordinary programming or API-contract violations. Prefer domain-specific exceptions when
  a failure has business meaning callers may need to distinguish.
- Distinguish invalid external input from valid input violating a domain rule. Input validation belongs at the delivery
  or application boundary; domain invariant failures belong to the domain.
- Use application exceptions for use-case failures meaningful to callers but not themselves domain invariants.
- Keep domain and application exceptions transport-agnostic. HTTP status codes, response schemas, localization, and
  other presentation concerns belong to the delivery layer.
- Do not require callers to inspect exception message text. Represent machine-relevant failure information through
  exception types or structured attributes.
- Keep user-facing localization out of domain exception semantics. Carry structured failure context and let the
  presentation layer produce external-facing messages.
- Translate third-party exceptions at adapter boundaries into stable capability-oriented failures when callers should
  not depend on a specific provider's exception model.
- Make retry decisions from failure semantics. Do not retry deterministic business-rule failures as transient
  infrastructure failures.
- Use exceptions for failure semantics rather than as a substitute for normal branching when absence or an alternative
  outcome is part of the expected API contract.
- Do not use `assert` for business rules, authorization, external input validation, or recoverable runtime invariants.
